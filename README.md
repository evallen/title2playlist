## Setup

1. Clone this repository.

2. Download and unzip the required playlist data to the `data/playlist/` folder 
   from [here](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/spotify-million-playlist-dataset-challenge). 

3. Install [Milvus, a vector-database](https://milvus.io/) and start running
   it locally.

4. Install the Python requirements:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Create the Milvus playlist embedding dataset by running the following
   scripts (in this order):
   * `scripts/data_scripts/create_milvus_dataset.py`
   * `scripts/data_scripts/remove_test_split.ipynb` (this removes 1000 points
     to act as a test split)

6. Create the Playlist-Song dataset by running the following script:
   * `scripts/data_scripts/playlist_song_dataset.py`

7. Run the recommendation engine!
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

## Other files

This repository also contains some extra scripts from our previous
attempts in this project, including our old idea on representing
playlists as regions in song audio feature space.

The metrics in our paper can be found in `data/scripts/test_scripts/evaluate.ipynb`, and their implementations in `common/metrics.py`.
